# WHAT IS NEXT JS ?

Next.js is a powerful React framework that facilitates the development of web applications by providing features such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes, enabling developers to create fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable applications with ease.

A library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform specific tasks. It provides functions and methods that can be called upon as needed.

A framework is a more comprehensive structure that provides a foundation for building applications. It includes a set of rules, conventions, and tools that dictate how the application should be organized and developed.

FRAMEWORK = libs + tools + conventions;
